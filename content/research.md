Economic and demographic factors underpin the rising importance of inheritance flows across advanced economies. Based on Italian micro-data about inter-generational asset transfers, this paper shows that their relevance extends before transfers and beyond assets, as expecting an inheritance robustly predicts the pursuit of higher education. Data also show that the intention to leave a bequest is strongly associated with having received or expecting an inheritance, consistently with heterogeneity and persistence in dynastic altruism. I rationalize the empirical findings through a simple model, where young agents from more altruistic dynasties acquire higher education to increase their long-term earnings, hence their ability to finance bequests. This perpetuates inter-generational disparities in education, income, and wealth. Through a richer quantitative lifecycle model, I show that heterogeneity in bequest motives can account for around 40% of the observed gap in student rates between youths who do and do not expect an inheritance. Throughout a set of counterfactual exercises, the strength of the link between inheritance expectations and education critically rests on high short-term costs and low expected long-term benefits from the latter within the lifecycle.


## [Domestic Inequality and Global Imbalances](/Mazza_Mijakovic_Domestic_Inequality_Global_Imbalances.pdf) 
### (joint work with [Andrej Mijakovic](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io))

Presented at (\* if by coauthor): *12th PhD Student Conference on International Macroeconomics (Paris Nanterre)*, *European Central Bank IPA Economic Meeting*\*, *Bank for International Settlements Research Seminar*\*, *2023 Annual Meeting of the Central Bank Research Association - CEBRA (New York)*, *23rd RIEF Doctoral Meeting*\*, *27th Theories and Methods in Macro - T2M (Amsterdam)*, *PSE-CEPR Policy Forum 2024*, *UCL Stone Center PhD Conference on Income and Wealth Inequality*

We document that higher income inequality is associated with higher current account balances for a large set of countries. A 1 percentage point increase in the share of income earned by the top 1 percent is associated with a 0.4-0.8 percentage point higher current account balance. This relation is driven by differences in saving rates but not investment. We rationalize this finding through a two-country heterogeneous agent model and show that, all else equal, capital flows from unequal to equal countries. Non-homotheticities in preferences generate higher saving rates by rich households which translate into current account surpluses under international capital mobility. The model also incorporates an explicit role for financial markets. We illustrate how financial forces can offset the effects of inequality and induce current account deficits in unequal countries such as the United States.

## Classical and Non-Classical Measurement Errors in Blood Pressure Measures from Understanding Society: an Estimation  
### (joint work with Thomas Crossley) 

In surveys, it is seldom possible to obtain the most accurate available measure of any variable of interest, given the high costs (monetary and not) associated to the necessary procedures. In the context of Understanding Society, we consider the setting of blood pressure measurements as gathered by nurses and compare them with self-taken and interviewer-taken ones. Assuming classical measurement error for nurse-taken measures and non-classical error for the other two sources, we estimate the parameters of interest through Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) in order to correct for any possible bias in measures exhibiting non-classical error.
